![AR-Pancreas-Teaser](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/468aba15-fd45-4689-a0dc-5ba505c7a303)

ARAS is an augmented reality assistance system designed for intraoperative navigation during open pancreatic surgery. ARAS was developed following a user-centered design process advised by experienced surgeons and was iteratively refined and evaluated in clinical trials. 

## Media Appearance 
The success of ARAS in assisting surgeons during extremely critical surgical procedures has captured the attention of various local and international media outlets.
